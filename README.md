## Real-Time Object Detection with Measurement Using OpenCV

A Python project that performs real-time object detection and measures object dimensions using a webcam. The program detects multiple objects, draws bounding boxes, labels them, and estimates their size based on pixel measurements.

## Features

Real-Time Object Detection using OpenCV’s DNN module with SSD MobileNet v3
Bounding Boxes drawn around detected objects
Object Labels with confidence percentages
Object Measurement in pixels (can be calibrated to real-world units)
Adjustable detection threshold for filtering low-confidence detections
Modular and extendable code for tracking, counting, or size-based applications
Optional enhancements: Save detected frames, video, or integrate with IoT devices

## Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (opencv-python)
Numpy
